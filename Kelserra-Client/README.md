## ProofOfConcept

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

## Setup

Setup the latest stable version of Node.js for the local machine you are working with from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

The Compiler Extension for C and C++ Code is needed to be installed. Please set the checkmark to true.

Setup Angular on the local machine with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

It can but also may not be neccessary to run this command to let Node.js run PowerShell Scripts if you are working with a Windows Machine:

Run in the Windows Power Shell: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.

Setup the Node.js Dependencies of the proof-of-concept with the command `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
